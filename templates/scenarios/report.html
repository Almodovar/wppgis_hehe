                    <p>
                        The Gully Creek watershed is a typical small agricultural watershed along the shoreline of Lake Huron. The watershed occupies 14.3 km2 within the larger North Gully watershed, and is located in northwest portion of the ABCA service area. The township of Goderich and Clinton are located 14 km north and 10 km east of the watershed, respectively. Similar to other lakeshore streams, the Gully Creek directly drains into Lake Huron, which has direct impacts on near shore water quality. The watershed has been classified as an Environmentally Sensitive Area.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2010, Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) established a Watershed Based BMP Evaluation (WBBE) program. The Gully Creek watershed, along with Zurich and Ridgeway watersheds, was selected as the study sites for the WBBE program. Extended from ABCA’s previous BMP initiatives and monitoring program, the WBBE program invested on implementation of BMPs, primarily conservation tillage, cover crop, and WASCoBs (Table 1), and monitoring of BMP effects. A modelling component was also built into the project to simulate watershed processes and examine water quality effects of various BMP scenarios.

                    <h2>MODEL INTRODUCTION</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        SWAT is a process based watershed model allowing the assessment of land management practice impacts on water, sediment, nutrient and other agricultural chemical yields in a watershed with varying soils, land use and management conditions over a long period of time. The model performs continuous simulations at a daily time step, and hence supports montly and annually predictions. The model is intended for long term simulations and is not capable of conducting detailed single-event flood routing. Weather, soil properties, topography, vegetation, and land management practices are the main inputs to the SWAT for simulating hydrologic and water quality processes in a watershed. For the Gully Creek watershed, input data can be obtained from OMAFRA, Environment Canada, and ABCA. Although data intensive, the integration of SWAT into GIS makes it convenient to use readily available datasets from various sources of climate, soil, topography, and land use information. Calibration and validation of the SWAT has been carried out based on flow and water quality data at in-stream and field-edge stations. By the comparison between the simulated and observed data, a reasonable model performance was achieved.

                    <br>
                    <h4>MODELLING PROCESSES</h4>
                    <p>
                        SWAT has eight major components including hydrology, weather, sedimentation, soil temperature, crop growth, nutrients, pesticides, and agricultural management. Additional components such as canopy storage, water redistribution within the snow and soil profile, lateral subsurface flow, reservoirs, ponds and wetlands, tributary channels, and return flow are also integrated into the hydrological component. Within the SWAT land phase hydrologic cycle (Figure 1), climate conditions in the watershed provide the moisture and energy inputs, and determine the relative importance of different components of the hydrologic cycle. </p>

                    <h4>BMP CHARACTERIZATION</h4>
                    <p>
                        In order to examine the effects of land management changes, four BMPs – conservation tillage, nutrient management, cover crop, and berm or water and sediment control basin (WASCOB) in SWAT were characterized. The characterization set up a basis for examining various BMP scenarios.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Conservation Tillage</b>: The SWAT modelling for the Gully Creek watershed characterized the following tillage practices: Chisel plow, generic conservation tillage, culti-packer pulverizer, disk plow, field cultivator, harrow, moldboard plow, no tillage done, deep ripper-subsoiler, rolling cultivator, and generic zero tillage. Five parameters are required to simulate tillage management in SWAT including month, day, operation number, tillage code and operational SCS-CN (CNOP).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Cover Crop</b>: In Ontario, the typical cover crop is red clover. For cover crop characterization in the SWAT modelling for the Gully Creek watershed, red clover was added to all crop fields with wheat production and corresponding production parameters such as seeding and harvesting dates.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Nutrient Management</b>: In SWAT modelling, fertilizer application is characterized by parameters such as date, month, fertilizer type, and fertilizer amount. For Gully Creek watershed, nutrient management is represented by fertilizer reduction (N and P). The fertilizer BMP (N and P) rates were calculated using NMAN3 software to represent optimal fertilizer rates without crop yield loss in comparing to the base scenario.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>WASCoBs</b>: SWAT initially does not include a WASCobs module. The module was developed independently by Guelph WEG as an important innovation to the SWAT modeling. For more information, please refer to the <i>SWAT Modelling of Agricultural BMPs in the Gully Creek Watershed</i> .

                    <h2>BMP Scenario</h2>
                    <p>
                        "Scenario" here is used to describe how BMPs will be applied and implemented to a group of fields/subbasins. One scenario, by itself, is sought to answer a "what-if" question, i.e <i>what environmental/economic effects can be achieved by implementing a set of BMPs</i>. Because of its descriptive nature and storylike representation, a scenario offers a vivid means of understanding a variety of BMP situations, and presents an effective tool for communication in collabroative settings. </p>
                    <p>
                        A scenario is implemented by reference to the typical process of agri-environmental programming for BMP adoption, within which four key elements are identified as scenario creation, scenario evaluation, scenario comparison and scenairo optimization. In a large, system develment is based upon the elaboration of user requirements and tasks of each element. Identifying design problems and prioritizing design moves are greatly faciliated by the use of scenario.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>SCENARIO CREATION</h4>
                    <p>
                        A scenario is created by assigning BMPs to selected fields/subbasins through the online mapping system. In this case, the BMP assignment relationship is shown by (Table 2).
